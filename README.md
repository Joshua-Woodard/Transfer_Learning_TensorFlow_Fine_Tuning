# Transfer_Learning_TensorFlow_Fine_Tuning
Jupyter Notebook created alongside course study on Transfer Learning in TensorFlow, focused on fine tuning.

## What it covers:
* Create `helper_functions.py` with helpful functions
* Augment data and visualize to see results
* Create model using Functional API and EfficientNetB0
* Create ModelCheckpoint callback to save best weights
* Fine tune an existing model
* View data on TensorBoard
